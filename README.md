## My mission here:

Project created by my coach Jordan, from the school of code. I was having a rough week and couldn't understand 
react and its components. Couldn't understand how to use UseState and props.

_In this project I try to take an API and generate random quotes._

Thank you Jordan!!

    -App
      - App.js

    -Header
      - Header.js

## Make sure to do regular git commits to see how you are getting on. 

ðŸ‘‰ 1a. Layout Each folder and file for you components as above.
 
<br>
 
ðŸ‘‰ 1b. Make sure to add a "ClassName" to each jsx element so you can Style each one in app.css

<br>

<h3 align="center"> ( Time to code ) </h3>


ðŸ‘‰ Create a handleClick function inside your app.js that console logs the word '**hello World**' , then pass down that function handleClick as a prop to the Button.js component.

ðŸ‘‰ inside Button.js add an onClick event  that calls  the function HandleClick that was passed down as a prop.
###### (  do npm run start & click the button to see if it logs in the console )

<br>
ðŸ‘‰Change the handleClick function in app.js to be an async function handleClick, then write out a fetch request that gets a qoute from this api.

<br>

``` https://api.kanye.rest ```

<br>

  
  If you need help making a fetch request use this link to show you how 

  https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-fetch-async-await/

Make sure to console log your data from your api to make sure you are getting back data.

ðŸ‘‰Above your Async Function create a useState that is instially set to an empty object.


ðŸ‘‰pass the useState to your main.js component as a prop and render it in the JSX/HTML

Once you click the button you should get a new Qoute each time on the page.

ðŸ’¥BONUS TASK:
  Try to re-create it again without looking at this guide.
